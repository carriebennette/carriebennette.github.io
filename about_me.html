			<p id="aboutme"> Hi! I'm a senior research scientist and freelance data visualization designer based in Seattle, WA. This site serves as a living portfolio of my research projects and data visualizations. Building this site (from scratch!) was also a fun way for me to flex my very new web design muscles üí™.<br><br>I ‚ù§Ô∏è discovering new knowledge and creating visually engaging, data-driven stories. Growing up my favorite subjects were science and art. I won a few art competitions as a kid and briefly considered studying art in college, but thought science was probably harder to fit into my life as a hobby. As an undergrad I studied biology and art history. Then, after graduating and realizing I have a truly terrible long-term memory ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, I decided to focus on more tangible skills and started learning to write code üë©‚Äçüíª. <br><br>I started my career as a research biostatistician at <a href="https://www.mskcc.org/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics" target="_new">Memorial Sloan Kettering</a>, where I wrote a lot of code to analyze national surveys, healthcare claims, and other large datasets. During my PhD at the <a href="https://sop.washington.edu/choice/" target="_new">University of Washington</a> I built statistical and economic models to inform health policy decisions. I also discovered that I could combine my love of scientific discovery &amp; art by creating data visualizations to communicate the results of complex models to non-technical decision makers.<br><br> Looking for more tangible and fast-paced work, I left the world of academia and joined <a href="flatiron.com" target="_new">Flatiron Health</a> (then still a startup), where I spent nearly 3 years analyzing and visualizing electronic health records data to inform drug development and regulatory decision-making. In early 2020 I decided to embark on a new adventure in global health üåç and joined the <a href="idmod.org" target="_new">Institute for Disease Modeling</a> as a senior research scientist. I continue to pursue my passion for data visualization by translating my own and others data-driven research into visually engaging stories as a freelance designer.</p>
