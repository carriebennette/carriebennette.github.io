	As an undergraduate, I was pre-med and studied biology and art history. I worked in a research lab for several years. I loved science, but did not love pipetting or dissecting rats or growing cell cultures. Just before my senior year, my PI moved the lab to Syracuse, which completely de-railed my plans for a senior research thesis.  Working in another lab was an option as I had independent funding, but deep down I really didnâ€™t want to learn more lab tech skills. So I ended up petitioning to take classes in the graduate school of public health. And while I had originally thought the courses just would look good for med school applications, almost immediately I saw the tremendous impact possible with public health research and switched my post-graduate focus from medicine to public health.
	<br><br>
	After I graduated BU I spent a summer working in the Office of Population Research at Princeton where I got to work with some fantastic academics and attend a lot of seminars.  My temporary office doubled as storage for the reference manuals for a statistical program called STATA.  Iâ€™d never heard of STATA when I started, but I got to see what economists and policy researchers could do with it when they presented at seminars, which was inspiring.  So before I left for a year abroad I ordered myself a CD-ROM copy ðŸ“€ of STATA and a biostatistics textbook ðŸ“•. 
	<br><br>
	And I read that textbook cover-to-cover in my year abroad in France. It kind of helped that I couldnâ€™t speak French for a few months so I didnâ€™t have too many friends at first.  It also helped that I loved it.
	<br><br>
	I ended up getting a truly amazing job at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center while I was still living in France. They actually hired me without ever meeting me so my first day was extra interesting. At MSK, I worked on a range of clinical and health services research projects and in my "free" time completed a masters at Columbia in public health. I built a lot of prediction models and conducted research measuring various factors that influenced the outcomes of patients who received surgery for cancer. At MSK my group often spent a tremendous amount of effort trying to understand whether a new type of treatment was even just a little better than the established treatment (ðŸ’Š vs ðŸ’‰?). The questions were interesting as a biostatistician because there were a lot of dimensions of patient outcomes to consider and a lot of analytic nuances to take into account, such as the learning rate of individual surgeons over time. But it also became a little frustrating because the one dimension we were not encouraged to look at was costs.  And the costs of the new treatments were often much, much higher. So I became increasingly interested in the economic side of the equation at work, ended up taking several graduate-level courses in economics at NYU after my masters, and eventually decided to pursue a PhD that would let me evaluate both the clinical and economic side of public health policies and programs.  
	<br><br>
	My experience at MSK and Columbia was great preparation going into my PhD program at the University of Washington. I tested out of most of the required courses and had a lot of flexibility in electives and free time to explore research areas. For my dissertation, I combined my prior expertise in prediction modeling with new skills I had learned at UW in decision analysis, economic evaluation, and Bayesian statistics.  I developed a framework for prioritizing publicly funded research in oncology based on the expected impact the research would have and worked closely with decision makers to implement these methods in their formal evaluation of clinical trial proposals. A big part of the work involved adapting a method called Value of Information analysis and getting non-economists to understand and actually trust the complex models.  This work was one of the very first applications of VOI to inform real decisions.   
	<br><br>
	After defending my dissertation, I stayed at UW and transitioned to a junior faculty position and focused my research on how economic and policy factors influenced investments in oncology from the pharmaceutical industry. And because a lot of my research involved communicating the results of complex analyses to decision makers who were not statisticians or modelers, I grew increasingly interested in data visualizationðŸ“‰ðŸ“Š. 
	<br><br>
	In early 2017, a start up called Flatiron Health called and pitched a remote role.  Flatiron Health is a healthcare technology company that develops software and analytic tools to analyze the data collected from the electronic health records of cancer patients. Iâ€™ve learned a tremendous amount from my colleagues in the last few years, especially the engineers.  When I started Iâ€™d never heard of git, or unit testing, or deep learning and had no idea what it meant to write code collaboratively. But I learned! They even let me be a director of the machine learning team, an opportunity I am forever grateful to have had. It was also interesting to conduct research outside of academia, where the work is extremely collaborative and the results often arenâ€™t intended for publication, but are instead used to inform a business or regulatory decision.
